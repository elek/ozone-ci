    Fixed unit test TestOzoneManagerHA#testReadRequest and TestOzoneManagerHA#testOMProxyProviderInitialization.
    
    The root cause is that they were using old OzoneClientFactory.getRpcClient() methods which doesn't take omServiceId, thus they failed to fail-over to the leader OM. This should be further addressed in HDDS-2105.
