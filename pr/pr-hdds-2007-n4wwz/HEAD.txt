    Move OM-related config check logic from BasicOzoneFileSystem to BasicOzoneClientAdapterImpl to avoid class loading problem. This should address the acceptance test failures.
    
    1. this also moved the default port selection logic to BasicOzoneClientAdapterImpl.
    2. this commit also addressed a potential bug that OmUtils.isOmHAServiceId(conf, omHost) would have caused in BasicOzoneFileSystem where conf isn't an OzoneConfiguration.
